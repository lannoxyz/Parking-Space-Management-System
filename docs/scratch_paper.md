cars we use hotwheels

we need a bit of 3d print and pcb design, python coding on AI vision
need to make 6 parking slot, 2 for staff, 3 for student, 1 for visitor

database record the number plates thats already exist, yellow permit staff white and red permit student, if no record default visitor
when car comes, camera detect it, record the number plate, the gate open. screen will display the avaliable parking slot (maybe a map also)

when exit camera detect numberplate again and open the gate

use phone can see the avaliable parking slots on an online website
total parking slots, empty slots, cars in campus that are finding/exit a parking slot, actual remaining slots
