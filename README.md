# Parking Space Management System — Campus Solution

This project aims to design an online **Parking Space Visibility System** that enhances the convenience and efficiency for drivers searching for available parking slots around the University of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM) campus.  
Our goal is simple: **no more endless campus parking hunts 🚗💨** — know where to park *before* you even turn the steering wheel.

## 🏫 Project Background & Purpose

We are students from **University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus (UNMC)**.  
This is a fully **open-source prototype project** exploring the feasibility of an integrated, real-time, on-campus parking management system.

The project was officially initiated on **24 November 2025** and has been submitted under the **EIRP Programme by the UNMC Robotics Society**.

- Provide real-time visibility of available parking spaces across campus  
- Improve traffic flow during peak hours  
- Reduce frustration and wasted time  
- Establish a scalable system that can be integrated with sensors, mobile apps, or campus infrastructure  
- Serve as a foundation for future campus-wide smart mobility systems
